# Challenge 3 Password Generator

## User Story

As A user
I WANT to be able to generate a password.
I will be prompted with a series of password criteria questions such as numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters for my password.
AND then my desired password length with selected criteria will show up on the webpage.

## Description

For homework 3 we were given a starter code and only had to focus on the JavaScript in order for the webpage to function.

Once the "Generate Password" is clicked you will be prompted with the desired length for your password. The length must be between 8-128. If you put anything lower than 8 or anything higher than 128 you will be alerted with "invalid password length entry". Then, you must confirm if you would like to include numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters in your desired password. Once you validate all the prompts, your new password with desired characters & length will appear in the textbox on the webpage.

# Motivation

My motivation for this assignment was to continue studying JavaScript and understand fully all it has to offer such as functions, Math properties and if, else, and else if statements.
